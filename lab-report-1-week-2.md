    After downloading and installing, you should see this window when you open it up.

## 2.Remote Connecting
If you are using a windows based computer, you should download OpenSSH first. Instruction is here: [Install OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)

After that, you need to look up your specific account for CSE 15L: [link here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

Then you need to open up VSCode and open a terminal, so you can connect to the server.
